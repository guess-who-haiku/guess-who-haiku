* User account creation and authentication
* Markov-chain text generator algorithm in haiku format
* Twitter API to source input text
* Interactive user experience throughout haiku generation and sharing
* Mobile first design
* Progressive Web App

## Technologies and Technical Challenges

### Backend: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express

### Frontend: React, Redux

### Markov Chain Algorithm
Markov Chains work by generating sentences based on recombination of elements of history of known sentences to generate meaningful sentences.

### A Progressive Web App
PWAs allow for features including push notification, home screen icon, full-screen and offline first functionality, providing a native-like experience for the user.

### Mobile-First Design
A design strategy where you start sketching and prototyping the smallest screen first and work your way up to larger screens. Essentially, itâ€™s about delivering the right user experience to the right device.
