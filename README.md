# Guess Who, Haiku

### [Try out Guess Who, Haiku!](https://guesswhohaiku.herokuapp.com/)

## Background and Overview

Ever dreamed of being a poet, but ended up deciding quips and witty turn-of-phrase just _wasn't your thing_?

Guess Who, Haiku is here to help! 

Craft outstanding haikus with the help of famous figures in history, celebrities, and the witsters of today's popular culture, and challenge your friends to be the first to GUESS WHO the voice is behind your newfound literary genius. 

This app consists of:

* A markov-chain text generation algorithm
* A syllable-counting algorithm 
* Mobile-first application design
* Immersive, delightful UI/UX

Guess Who, Haiku leverages the MERN app development stack which consists of: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## Game Screens
### Create a Haiku

The landing page for our application is an invitation to generate a haiku, selecting up to three figures whose voices will be used to build the poem. Once the haiku is generated, the user has a few choices: if they are dissatisfied with the haiku, they can either regenerate a new haiku with the same figures they had selected, or begin the haiku generation process again from the beginning. If they want to use the haiku, they will be prompted to sign up or log in, and can then save the haiku and share it at a later date, or immediately challenge others friends on the application to solve the haiku.

### Solve a Haiku Challenge

All of the haikus that a user has been challenged to will appear on their `My Challenges` page, categorized as either `solved` or `unsolved`. When a user clicks on an unsolved haiku and accepts the challenge to solve it, they will be prompted to choose the haiku authors from a semi-randomized list of six characters. Their progress will be timed, and the sooner they solve the challenge correctly after accepting it, the more points they will receive for that haiku.

### View a Haiku

Users can similarly view all of the haikus that they have created. Each haiku "card" will show if the haiku has been shared and who it has been shared with, as well as give the user the option to delete the haiku. The back of each haiku "card" shows who has solved the haiku most quickly, if anyone has solved it.

### Leaderboard

The cross-application leaderboard shows the top ten users in two categories: highest scores from solving haikus, and most haikues made. If a logged-in user places on either board, their name will be highlighted in red.

* Mobile-first design
* Progressive Web App

## Technologies and Technical Challenges0

This project is built on a MongoDB, Mongoose, Express backend, with a React / Redux frontend (MERN stack). We utilized React Hooks, Styled Components and an overall componentized project structure extensively throughout this project. 


### Markov Chain Algorithm for Natural Language Generation (NLG)
Markov Chain Text generation algorithm, transform structured data into natural language by generating sentences based on recombination of elements of history of known sentences to generate seemingly semantically meaningful sentences. For this haiku guessing game, we extended the semantic generation algorithm to factor in the standard haiku syllable count (5-7-5) as well as article filtering (so that words such as the, and, and if don't end phrases). For more information on the technologies, check out our project's Github repo.

### A Progressive Web App
PWAs allow for features including push notification, home screen icon, full-screen and offline first functionality, providing a native-like experience for the user.

### Mobile-First Design
A design strategy where you start sketching and prototyping the smallest screen first and work your way up to larger screens. Essentially, itâ€™s about delivering the right user experience to the right device.

### Technical Challenges
- Configuring our text generator to output semantic text in the proper 5-7-5 syllable structure. Counting english language sylllables is a non-trivial problem involving logic to parse phonemes and other word parts accurately. We used `test-driven-development` to build out our test cases using `Mocha`, and developed a processing algorithm that would more accurately parse words.
- Responsive and intuitive styling with `styled-components`. Using `styled-components` greatly reduced redundant styling work across components with shared visual themes. 
- Finding an elegant frontend file architecture - favored the "duck" react-redux file structure in order to better facilitate collaboration and reduce merge conflicts. 
- We designed our backend database structure and API endpoint using a non-relational design principles, greatly simplifying API for client (our app), resulting in less overall API calls.
